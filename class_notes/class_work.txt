1) design the table schema
- what tables you think we need?
- what columns will the tables have?
- what tables are related to each other?


2) write out the query for creating the table

PRIMARY_KEY 
FOREIGN_KEY
UNIQUE
NOT_NULL
DEFAULT



what can help you "discover" the DB structure?

- read the case study again and identify physical objects/events (Customer, Dish, Table, Order...) 
- look for verbs that connect the nouns (Customers place Orders, Employees work Shifts)
